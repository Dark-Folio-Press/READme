## About

Welcome to Dark Folio Press: a small, independent publisher exploring the intersection of **public domain works**, **original fiction**, and **digital innovation**.

### What We Publish

- 📚 **Public Domain Works**: Carefully curated classics and forgotten gems from the literary past

- 💾 **Digital Downloads**: Software, apps, and digital content for modern readers and developers
- ⭐ **Daily Horoscopes**: Created by our custom app, blending celestial wisdom with code

## The Development Journey

We're on a path of continuous learning as a **self-taught, AI-assisted developer**. Our codebase reflects an evolving understanding of how **symbolic systems**, **software constraints**, and **human agency** can coexist in creative harmony.

## Philosophy

Our work is guided by the belief that technology and tradition, data and storytelling, constraints and creativity aren't opposites  they're collaborators. Each line of code is a conversation between what was, what is, and what might be.
